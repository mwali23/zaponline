Project Purpose
Zambia's Access to Power (ZAP) aims to enhance public awareness of power outages and electricity availability in Zambia, addressing the ongoing energy crisis the country faces. With frequent and unpredictable outages, families and industries that rely on electricity are significantly impacted. ZAP seeks to improve economic conditions by providing a platform that leverages crowdsourcing for real-time information sharing about outages.

The project recognizes the challenges faced by ZESCO, Zambia's state-owned utility, which relies heavily on hydropower (85% of capacity) and struggles to maintain consistent energy production due to cyclical droughts. Currently, ZESCO communicates outage information through static PDF documents and text messages, which are often inadequate for convey-ing timely updates. By offering a more dynamic and user-friendly platform for disseminat-ing outage information, ZAP empowers Zambians with the tools they need to make in-formed decisions and better plan their daily lives amidst the country's electricity challenges.
